# ASH Security Technical Details

This document provides an in-depth technical explanation of ASH's internal security mechanisms, assumptions, boundaries, and cryptographic design.

If you are looking for high-level guidance, please see:

👉 [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md)

This document is intended for:

- Security engineers
- Pentesters
- Auditors
- Researchers
- Enterprise reviewers

## Security Model Overview

ASH protects request integrity at the protocol level.

It ensures:

- Requests cannot be modified in transit
- Requests cannot be replayed
- Requests are bound to a specific endpoint
- Contexts are single-use and short-lived

ASH focuses strictly on **request integrity and replay protection**, not full application security.

---

## Security Goals

ASH is designed to mitigate:

- Request tampering
- Parameter manipulation
- Replay attacks
- Endpoint substitution
- Client-side abuse
- Certain classes of automation attacks

ASH is NOT intended to replace:

- Authentication systems
- Authorization systems
- Malware protection
- Full intrusion detection
- Transport encryption (TLS)

---

## Threat Model Assumptions

ASH assumes:

1. Requests are generated by a legitimate client at creation time
2. HTTPS/TLS protects transport confidentiality
3. Authentication/authorization are enforced externally
4. Server infrastructure is not already compromised

If these assumptions are violated, additional protections are required.

---

## Security Boundaries

### ASH guarantees

- Request integrity validation
- Replay protection
- Single-use enforcement
- Endpoint binding

### ASH does NOT guarantee

- User identity validation
- Permission checks
- Business logic correctness
- Server compromise protection

ASH validates **whether a request was altered**, not whether it is safe to execute.

## Cryptographic Design

| Component | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Proof | HMAC-SHA256 |
| Body Hash | SHA-256 |
| Nonce | CSPRNG |
| Key Derivation | HMAC-based KDF |
| Comparison | Constant-time |

### Design Principles

- No custom cryptography
- Industry-standard primitives only
- Constant-time comparisons
- Deterministic verification
- Minimal attack surface

---

## Anti-Replay Architecture

Replay prevention uses multiple layers:

### 1. Single-Use Contexts

Contexts are consumed immediately after verification.

### 2. TTL Enforcement

Each context has strict expiration.

- Recommended: 30 seconds
- Maximum: 5 minutes

### 3. Endpoint Binding

Each context is bound to:

- HTTP method
- Path
- Query

Prevents cross-endpoint reuse.

### 4. Timestamp Validation

Requests outside time window are rejected.

---

## Defense-in-Depth Features

Additional hardening:

- Constant-time comparisons
- Secure memory clearing
- SQL identifier validation
- Context isolation
- Expiration enforcement
- Deterministic request hashing

These reduce:

- Timing attacks
- Memory forensics
- Injection risks
- Side-channel attacks

---

## Storage Considerations

### Recommended

- Redis with TLS
- SQL with encryption at rest

### Avoid

- In-memory stores in distributed clusters
- Unsynchronized shared state

Context stores must guarantee:

- Atomic operations
- Single-use enforcement
- TTL expiration

---

## Secure Memory Handling

Sensitive secrets are cleared after use.

### Python

```python
with secure_derive_client_secret(...) as secret:
    ...
```

### Node.js

```typescript
withSecureString(...)
```

This reduces memory forensics risk.

---

## Context Lifecycle

1. Context created
2. Nonce generated
3. Client signs request
4. Server verifies
5. Context consumed
6. Context destroyed

Contexts cannot be reused.

---

## Known Limitations

ASH does not protect against:

- Compromised clients
- Stolen credentials
- Server compromise
- Business logic abuse
- Insider threats
- Transport layer attacks without TLS

ASH must be used alongside standard security practices.

---

## Security Review & Auditing

ASH undergoes:

- Internal reviews
- Protocol analysis
- Attack simulations
- Replay testing
- Timing attack testing

Audit reports may be published under:

```
reports/security-audit/
```

---

## Recommended Production Setup

For maximum protection:

- Always use HTTPS
- Rotate keys regularly
- Use short TTLs
- Monitor logs
- Enable rate limiting
- Keep clocks synchronized
- Use encrypted stores
- Run dependency audits

---

## Final Notes

ASH is a protocol-level integrity system.

It strengthens request security but does not replace full application security architecture.

Security is layered.

ASH is one layer.

Use it together with authentication, authorization, and secure infrastructure.
